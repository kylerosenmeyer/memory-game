# One Time Traffic Signs
A Memory Game.
Coding Bootcamp HW19 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**One Time Traffic Signs** is an interactive web game built in react. It tests the users memory by selecting 14 signs that randomly appear on the page.

This app is useful to learn the principals of building web apps with react.js and applying the fundamentals of components, props, and states.
